# Image-Watermarking-for-Copyright-Protection
A hybrid visible–invisible watermarking system using DWT, SVD, and spread-spectrum techniques to embed a colored logo and a robust hidden watermark into images. The project improves ownership protection, resists attacks like noise, compression, and cropping, and enables reliable watermark extraction.
